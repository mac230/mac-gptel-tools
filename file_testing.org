The API for certain llm models will not accept files or specific file types.  In
the context of gptel, a notable example the inability to send pdfs openai's
models via the API (https://github.com/karthink/gptel/issues/1036).  I've found
it's useful to have a test set of files to query whether file streaming (set via
'gptel-track-media') is working with a specific model.  The following provides a
series of files and prompts for this purpose:
