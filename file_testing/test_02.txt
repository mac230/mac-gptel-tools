Figure 3.17 For the car to move smoothly along the track, the
function must be both continuous and differentiable.
Solution
For the function to be continuous at x = −10,
lim
x → −10−
f (x) = f (−10). Thus, since
lim
x → 10−
f (x) = 1 (−10) 2 − 10b + c = 10 − 10b + c
10
and f (−10) = 5, we must have 10 − 10b + c = 5. Equivalently, we have c = 10b − 5.
For the function to be differentiable at −10,
f ′ (10) =
lim
x → −10
f (x) − f (−10)
x + 10
must exist. Since f (x) is defined using different rules on the right and the left, we must evaluate this limit from
the right and the left and then set them equal to each other:
lim −
x → −10

x + bx + c − 5
f (x) − f (−10)
= lim − 10
x + 10
x + 10
x → −10
=
1 x 2 + bx + (10b − 5) − 5
lim − 10
x → −10
x + 10

lim x − 100 + 10bx + 100b
10(x + 10)
x → −10−
(x + 10)(x − 10 + 10b)
= lim −
10(x + 10)
x → −10
= b − 2.
=
Substitute c = 10b − 5.
Factor by grouping.
We also have
− 14 x + 52 − 5
f (x) − f (−10)
= lim
x + 10
x + 10
x → −10+
x → −10+
lim
=
−(x + 10)
lim
x → −10+ 4(x + 10)
= − 1.

This gives us b − 2 = − 1 . Thus b = 7 and c = 10⎝7 ⎠ − 5 = 25 .
